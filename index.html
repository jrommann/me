<h1>About Me | <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> | <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></h1>

<p>I’m a creator, builder, gamer and geek. I grew up raising sheep, honey bees, gardening and doing a lot of manual labor.</p>
<p>I try my best to live my life by the teachings of Jesus. If you are not familiar with them and want to know more please ask me and we can have a civil discussion. I let my actions speak more than my words.</p>
<p>I love playing competitive games, in many forms, from the virtual to the physical. I really enjoy computer games, table top games and playing most sports. Competition makes us better.</p>
<p>I am a hard worker, like to get things done in an efficient and timely manner, and I love solving problems.</p>
